# BIU-OOP

This Java project is a first-year Object-Oriented Programming assignment at Bar-Ilan University.
It features a game with an interactive background created solely using classes, without any images.

## First stage

In the first stage, the goal is to prevent two balls from touching the ground before nightfall.
As the game progresses, clouds move across the backdrop, and hitting bricks causes apples to fall from the tree in the
background.
