# BIU-OOP

This Java project is a first-year Object-Oriented Programming assignment at Bar-Ilan University.
It features a game with an interactive background created solely using classes, without any images.

## Level One

The first level is simple - you need to hit the brick in order to pass it.

## Level Two

In the second level, your task is to target the bricks to allow rain to reach the grass.

## Level Three

In the third level, the goal is to prevent two balls from touching the ground before nightfall.
As the game progresses, clouds move across the backdrop, and hitting bricks causes apples to fall from the tree in the
background.

## Level Four

In the fourth level you need to strike the bricks to illuminate the surroundings.
The more bricks you shatter, the brighter it becomes!

The game is over when you turn on the light (you don't have to break all the bricks).
